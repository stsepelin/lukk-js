"lukk-core": patch
---

Export `isSameOrigin(base, path)` (the same-origin credential guard) and `lukkError(status, statusText, body)` (the Laravel-error `{ message, status, errors }` builder) so lukk-nuxt's `useLukkFetch` reuses the exact same logic instead of duplicating it — keeping the security-critical same-origin check and the error shape identical across both transports.
