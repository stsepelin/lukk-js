Security hardening (pre-publish review).

- **lukk-core:** the client now sends `redirect: 'manual'` and surfaces a 3xx as an error instead of following it. On a server/undici fetch (SSR/`direct` mode, or any raw `lukk-core` consumer) a cross-origin redirect would otherwise forward the custom `X-Lukk-Confirmation` step-up header to the target (the `Authorization` bearer is stripped by the platform, custom headers are not).
- **lukk-nuxt (BFF proxy):** `bff.ts` now reads the sealed session **read-only first** and only opens the read-write session when a request actually stores or clears tokens — so an anonymous, failed-login, or tampered/expired-seal request no longer mints an empty `__Host-lukk-session` cookie (aligning `bff.ts` with the app-API proxy).
- **lukk-nuxt (BFF proxy):** the proxy now `console.warn`s when the sealed `__Host-lukk-session` cookie nears the 4096-octet browser limit (RFC 6265bis §5.6) — above which the browser silently drops it and every request becomes anonymous. A bloated access token (many `Lukk::tokenClaimsUsing` claims) is the usual cause; see the sealed-session claims budget in the transport-modes docs.
- **lukk-nuxt (`useLukkForm`):** `isDirty` now serializes the baseline once (cached) instead of re-stringifying both sides on every keystroke.
- **lukk-core:** the origin-scoped `credentials` mode is now applied *after* the caller's `init`, so a caller can't override it (consistent with `redirect`).
