`login()` and `twoFactorChallenge()` now accept **extra fields**.

`email`/`password` (and the 2FA challenge fields) stay required, but you can pass additional fields — `remember`, a captcha token, a tenant id — without a `TS` cast, and they're sent to Laravel as-is:

```ts
await login({ email, password, remember: true, captcha })
```

The input types are widened to `LoginInput = LoginCredentials & Record<string, unknown>` (and `TwoFactorInput` for the challenge), exposed from `lukk-core`. lukk ignores unknown fields on the default login path; to act on them (or accept a different credential field like `username`), take over login on the server with `Lukk::authenticateUsing`. Purely additive and non-breaking — existing `login({ email, password })` calls are unaffected.
